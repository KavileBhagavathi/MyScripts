DESCRIPTION

Data from DNS of pipe flow at Re=2400, 3000, 10000:
- The DNS was perfromed with a spectral code in cylindrical coordinates
- The boundary conditions in the axial direction are periodic
- The length of the pipe is L_z=266R, 100.53R, 12.566R, respectively
- The mass-flux is kept constant over time, so that the pressure gradient is time dependent

DATA FILES

1- spectra_M.dat: spectrum in the azimuthal direction (averaged over time, axial and radial directions). The first column is the mode (m) and the second the corresponding energy.

2- vel_profile.dat: mean streamwise velocity profile. The first column is the radial coordinate and the second the streamwise velocity (averaged over time, azimuthal and axial directions).

3- vel_point.dat: velocity at fixed points in the domain as a function of time. The first column of the file is time. The three follwoing columns are radial, azimuthal and axial velocity at (r,theta,z)=(r,0,0), where r is given in the first line of the file. Th next six columns correspond to the three velocity components at (r,theta,z)=(r, 2*pi/3, L_z/3), and (r,theta,z)=(r, 4*pi/3, 2L_z/3) respectively.
